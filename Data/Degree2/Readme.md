Each file contains data of Maass form of the specified level (with trivial character) in the form of a Matematica list with each entry representing a Maass form.

Each entry is a list of 8 values that specify the Maass form. They are in order: 
{Level, Character (1), Weight (0), Symmetry (0 = even, 1 = odd), Sign of functional equation (1/-1), Fricke eigenvalue (1/-1), Maass form eigenvalue, Coefficients} 

There is data for all prime levels p < 1000 (except 29 which is missing at the moment)
